from what I observe from what’s going on, I would say I am the least important person.and I would say it doesn’t really matter…we take mediocre deaccessions and we seek the change, and a couple of days later we lose interest anyway and want to leave around 5 to mind our lives, and I don’t think this is bad.Yesterday I took a decision:I don’t have enough money to go to the doctor.and I was seriously considering life in general and having suicidal thoughts last weekend.and my life sucks on so many levels.emotionally in pain from losing my beloved mama, my feelings are in pain from relying on people OR to consider dramatic relations JUST to wave the sad feelings from mom’s death, and painfully working environment.and I seriously, have no one, no attachments, nothing that makes me want to live.but then I thought, I owed my mom to live, and to enjoy it, I was lucky enough to have her, to give me space to enjoy fucking in my own room, and to smoke whatever and to enjoy what I want, she just said, don’t smoke a lot or hurt your self because I love you and I am scared about you. She was literally a fabulous person and her last wishes that I live and enjoy my life and to feel that I am ok.when she died, my sister, my uncle said, enjoy your life, live, and just focus on life and what you want..you don’t owe anyone anything anymore..

I decided not to go into the medicines path, I’ve been there. And I don’t want to get shit in my mind chemistry because I know this path already.I decided to change my life a bit, to care about important stuff for myself. my health, and my life. And what I feel good for me.I was never selfish, but I think I owe my self to be a bit more selfish.this takes us to work, I will really try to sort it out for my self, and by default this getting sort for the team I think. When I care less in a good way and give the team what they think is good; which I believe not to bullshit or harass or interrupt, this will be good for both sides.I still learn the SRE and I want OPS but I still want to work here a bit more. It’s important for me meanwhile not to juggle jobs because I basically not stable financially or emotionally.
