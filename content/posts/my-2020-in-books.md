Just starting to make writing in English a habit again, so I will make this post short and sweet.



This year I've only read 12 books. I will put my picks of 2020 here.

* **At the Existentialist Café**: Freedom, Being, and Apricot Cocktails - Sarah Bakewell
* Rapport sur moi (**Report on myself**) - Grégoire Bouillier
* **The Waste Land** -  T. S. Eliot
* El prisionero del cielo (**The Prisoner of Heaven**) - Carlos Ruiz Zafón
* Briefe an einen jungen Dichter (**Letters to a Young Poet**) - Rainer Maria Rilke
* Sachlicher Bericht über das Glück, ein Morphinist zu sein (**Short Treatise on the Joys of Morphinism**) - Hans Fallada

As enormously as I'd like to talk about these books, I know that reading's taste opposes from one person to another. And, to be completely frank, I seldom review my books. Growing up with reading taught me to appreciate the book and absorb it more than showing the people why I like it. Reading is personal.
