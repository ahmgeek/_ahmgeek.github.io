When it comes to machines, I choose desktops over laptops for tow reasons , I can upgrade it when I want, and I can't forget it somewhere.

Of course there's a bunch of other reasons; I am a gamer, I like desks, I love keyboards - specially mechanical ones -,<br> and I believe I have an insecurity issue! if I stared at one monitor, so I'd rather to stare at three!<br>
but I can live without any of these as I tend to be a really resilient person who deals  with the current status - whatever it is - as is. <br/>

###**Chassis**



I use a [Thermaltake Chaser A31 mid-tower ](http://www.thermaltakeusa.com/Chassis/Mid_Tower_/Chaser/C_00001951/Chaser_A31_/Design.htm) as a container for my Digital toys.<div style="float: right;">![Chaser A31](/images/posts/pic1.jpg "Chaser A31")</div>

I wished I could get an Alien Look chassis, but somehow the store salesman convinced me to buy this as it have a very cool sport design and very handy when it comes to cleaning etc..!

the only thing I hate about it that it comes without any handles for carrying. 
I usually get bored from the look of my desk, so from time to time I randomly reallocate the stuff, so carrying the case to put it somewhere else becomes pretty Hard.. 
so I just hug the case and roll my hands over it to move it around, sort of expression of feelings, eh?

The case is really well designed to be fully modular, easy replacement for parts, and great cooling potential and options. 
 it also comes with, cable management, hard drive bays, air filters, and two 120mm fans with a black blue LED fan, that blue light catch your eyes from the first sight at the case windowed side panel, believe me, that's very neat.

At last, for me it's just a container, what really matters is its entrails right?.
