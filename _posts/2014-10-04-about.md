Hey you, my name is Ahmad Abd-Elghany, I was born in 1/1/1991, that's not so young not too old. And yeah, lots of ones right there.<br>Currently I live in
[Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt), ~~and no, we don't ride camels to go to work, we live the 21st century so we ride people instead.~~

I currently live and work from beautiful [Linz, Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linz).

I love technology, actually i am a very enthusiastic about the domination of machines upon this world, so i am trying to Make 'Em succeed in this mission.
I also try to make humans do sports by working at [runtastic](http://runtastic.com).

I have no more words to say about myself right now so, let me put a picture of my head and
say bye bye!
